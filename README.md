# Crankycyclops_ConfigurableProduct

Magento core currently lacks the ability to send out download links in the order confirmation email when the downloadable product that was purchased was a configurable product option. See: https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12885

To install, cd to the directory of your magento installation and run the following command:
```
composer require crankycyclops/magento2-configurable-downloadable-product
```
