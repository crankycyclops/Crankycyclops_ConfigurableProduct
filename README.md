# Crankycyclops_ConfigurableProduct
A Magento 2 module that modifies the order confirmation email for configurable products to include download links if the ordered option is downloadable

Magento core currently lacks the ability to send out download links in the order confirmation email when the downloadable product that was purchased was a configurable product option. See: https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/12885

This module rectifies that problem. The code needs more testing, and I also need to make it installable via composer. Coming soon :)
